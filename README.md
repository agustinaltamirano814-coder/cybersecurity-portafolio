Modulo 2 
In this module, I learned about some notable cyber attacks from the past. One attack used social engineering, sending emails with titles like “I love you.” People opened the emails, unknowingly infecting their computers with a virus.

I also learned about attacks that were originally non-malicious but went wrong. For example, the Morris Worm was created to measure the size of the internet. The worm counted infections and spread to other computers. However, it malfunctioned, repeatedly installing itself on the same machines until they ran out of memory, inadvertently taking many companies offline.

Through this reading, I gained insight into common attack types and their impacts. I also understood why social engineering is so effective. While this is just a brief introduction to attack types, the program offers many opportunities to deepen my understanding of how to identify and defend against cybersecurity threats.

The module also emphasized staying calm during a data breach, which reminded me of my experience as a special operations operator. Remaining composed in high-pressure situations is critical, especially when everyone else is panicking.

We also covered the 8 CISSP security domains, which help organize the tasks of a security analyst. Each domain focuses on a different area or function. Organizations can focus on one domain or multiple domains depending on their needs. I found the Security and Risk Management domain particularly interesting.

I’ve completed Module 2 and am becoming increasingly familiar with cybersecurity concepts. I now understand some of the fundamental principles and practices in the field.
