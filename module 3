# Module 3 – Security Frameworks, Controls, and the CIA Triad

## Overview
This module introduced **security frameworks**, **security controls**, and the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) Triad**.  

Security frameworks provide a **structured approach** to implementing a security lifecycle, which consists of continuously evolving policies and standards. Frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations (laws) work together to manage security and ensure that every stakeholder contributes to minimizing risk.

## Key Concepts

### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures information is accessible only to authorized users.  
- **Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and reliability of data.  
- **Availability**: Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed.  

### Security Frameworks
Examples of widely adopted frameworks include:  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Voluntary framework with standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk.  
- **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**: Provides a structured process for integrating security and risk management into system development.  

> Note: Specific requirements and guidelines may vary depending on the type of organization.  

### Compliance and Controls
Beyond NIST CSF and RMF, security professionals must be familiar with additional **controls, frameworks, and compliance standards** to safeguard organizations and individuals.

## Professional and Ethical Responsibilities
Security professionals have both **legal** and **ethical** obligations to protect their organization and stakeholders.  

- Remain impartial, honest, and law-abiding.  
- Be transparent and evidence-based in decision-making.  
- Act consistently and ethically in addressing security challenges.  
- Stay informed and continuously expand expertise.  

### Example: HIPAA
The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** is a U.S. federal law that protects patients’ **Protected Health Information (PHI)**.  
- PHI cannot be shared without patient consent.  
- Organizations must notify patients if their data is compromised.  
- Security professionals play a key role in ensuring compliance with HIPAA obligations.

## Key Takeaways
- **Ethics** are central to daily work in cybersecurity.  
- **CIA Triad** informs organizations on how to address risk in security policies and systems.  
- **NIST CSF** provides standards and best practices for managing cyber risk.  
- Staying **current with frameworks, controls, and compliance laws** is essential to ensuring security at both organizational and individual levels.
